{The body ownership across different avatars is as follows: elf + with retargeting (M = 1.56, SD = 1.42), elf + without retargeting (M = −1.57, SD = 1.19), cat ear + with retargeting (M = 1.11, SD = 1.70), cat ear + without retargeting (M = −1.76, SD = 1.16), dog + with retargeting (M = 1.31, SD = 2.09), and dog + without retargeting (M = −2.20, SD = 0.68).}

{The Friedman test, followed by post-hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, indicated significant differences between with retargeting and without retargeting conditions for each virtual avatar (elf: Z = −3.723, p < 0.001; cat ear: Z = −3.245, p < 0.001; dog: Z = −3.636, p < 0.001).}
